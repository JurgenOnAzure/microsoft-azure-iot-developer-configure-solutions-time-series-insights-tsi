Hi!

Here you'll find the demo code for my Pluralsight course [Microsoft Azure IoT Developer: Configure Solutions for Time Series Insights (TSI)](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/iot-tsi).

I hope you enjoyed the course. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate don't contact me!

## iot-developer-tsi-m1

You can use this .NET project, used in the first module in the course, to generate and send sample telemetry for multiple devices to Azure IoT Hub, for example to use as a data source in Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) or Time Series Insights (TSI).

## iot-developer-tsi-m2

The same project as in module one, with a small addition to include a sample fuel level in the telemetry. This is used in the second module in the course, for the model demo.

## rest-samples

This folder contains a Postman collection with sample calls from one of the demos, to do various operations against the Time Series Insights environment.
