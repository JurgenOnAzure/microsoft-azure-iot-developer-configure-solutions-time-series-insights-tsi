# What's in this folder?

This folder contains a Postman collection with sample calls from one of the demos, to do various operations against the Time Series Insights environment.

## Configuring Postman

1. If you're not familiar with postman, you can download it for free and find all documentation here: https://www.postman.com

2. To use the collection with the sample calls, import it into Postman.

   For help on using collections, see here: https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data.

3. The collection uses the following variables, so make sure to create them in Postman, and fill in the right values from your own Time Series Insights environment and app registration. See the demo in the course for more info:
